## 1. Basic Integral Notation

The integral of a function $f(x)$ with respect to $x$ over an interval $[a, b]$ is denoted as:

$$
\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx
$$

In this expression:

- $\int$ is the integral sign.
- $f(x)$ is the integrand, the function to be integrated.
- $a$ and $b$ are the limits of integration.
- $dx$ indicates the variable of integration.

### 1.1. Example: Area Under a Curve

Consider the function $f(x) = x^2$. The integral of $f(x)$ from 0 to 1 is calculated as :

$$
\int_{0}^{1} x^2 \, dx = \left[ \frac{x^3}{3} \right]_{0}^{1} = \frac{1}{3} - 0 = \frac{1}{3}
$$

This integral represents the area under the curve $y = x^2$ from $x = 0$ to $x = 1$.

## 2. Properties of Integrals

Integrals have several important properties that make them useful in various mathematical and physical applications.

### 2.1. Linearity

Integrals are linear, which means:

$$
\int_{a}^{b} [cf(x) + dg(x)] \, dx = c\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx + d\int_{a}^{b} g(x) \, dx
$$

where $c$ and $d$ are constants.

### 2.2. Additivity Over Intervals

The integral of a function over a larger interval can be broken down into the sum of integrals over smaller intervals:

$$
\int_{a}^{c} f(x) \, dx = \int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx + \int_{b}^{c} f(x) \, dx
$$

### 2.3. Integral of a Constant

The integral of a constant $c$ with respect to $x$ over an interval $[a, b]$ is:

$$
\int_{a}^{b} c \, dx = c(b - a)
$$

## 3. Definite vs. Indefinite Integrals

### 3.1. Definite Integral

A definite integral has specific limits of integration $a$ and $b$:

$$
\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx
$$

This represents the exact area under the curve between $x = a$ and $x = b$.

### 3.2. Indefinite Integral

An indefinite integral does not have specified limits of integration and includes a constant of integration $C$:

$$
\int f(x) \, dx = F(x) + C
$$

where $F(x)$ is the antiderivative of $f(x)$, and $C$ is an arbitrary constant.

### 3.3. Example: Finding an Antiderivative

To find the indefinite integral of $f(x) = 3x^2$, we perform the following steps:

$$
\int 3x^2 \, dx = x^3 + C
$$

Here, $x^3$ is the antiderivative of $3x^2$, and $C$ is the constant of integration.

## 4. Applications of Integrals

Integrals have a wide range of applications in various fields, including physics, engineering, and economics. Some of the most common applications include:

### 4.1. Calculating Areas

The area under a curve can be found using a definite integral, as demonstrated earlier.

### 4.2. Calculating Volumes

Integrals can also be used to calculate the volume of a solid of revolution. For example, the volume $V$ of a solid formed by rotating the curve $y = f(x)$ around the x-axis from $x = a$ to $x = b$ is given by:

$$
V = \pi \int_{a}^{b} [f(x)]^2 \, dx
$$

### 4.3. Solving Differential Equations

Integrals are used to solve differential equations, which model a wide range of physical phenomena, from population growth to electrical circuits.

### 4.4. Computing Total Accumulated Change

In economics, integrals are used to compute total accumulated change, such as finding the total profit over a period by integrating the profit function.

## 5. Conclusion

Integrals are a powerful tool in mathematics, allowing us to calculate areas, volumes, and more. By understanding the basic concepts and properties of integrals, you can apply them to a wide range of problems in calculus and beyond.

This guide has provided an introduction to integrals, but there's much more to explore, including advanced techniques like integration by parts, partial fractions, and numerical integration methods. Keep practicing, and you'll become proficient in using integrals to solve complex problems.
