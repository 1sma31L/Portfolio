# Personal Website, Portfolio, and Blog

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This repository contains the source code for my personal website, portfolio, and blog. That showcases my skills and the projects I've done. And my thoughts and experiences as blog posts.

## Description

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I built this website using `Next.js` for its slick routing SSR and SSG for statically generating blogs at runtime, `React` framework, and `Tailwind CSS`, a utility-first CSS framework. I am also using `TypeScript` to write the code for this website to capture errors at development phase with its great LSP. 
 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I built this website from scratch, without using any templates or themes, so that I can learn more about web development and improve my skills and also wanted to make a place for my thoughts for the world to see.
